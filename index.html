  <h1>Hypothesis: With climate change, we predict that there is a greater strain on quality of life</h1>
  <h2>Decompose</h2>
<ol>
  <li>With climate change, we predict that there is a greater strain on quality of life</li>
 <li> Defining climate change as extremes in both heat index, wind speed, and precipitation</li>
 <li> Quality-of-life measures are defined by crime rates, property values, and traffic fatalities</li>
 <li> Four of the most populous cities in the United States: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia</li>
 <li> Measuring our hypothesis with U.S. cities allows us to measure climate change on quality of life without having to resolve socioeconomic factors that would interfere with measuring the data set</li>
  </ol>
<h2>Data Retrieval </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Quality-of-life measures began by finding the Open Data Websites for the four major cities</li>
    <li>Traffic Fatality</li>
    <li>Federal Housing Finance Agency</li>
    <li>Weather from Meteostat.net</li>
    <li>Due to data availability we decided on 2012 and 2019. Earlier than 2012 datasets were not available for all cities.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Data Cleaning </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Jupyter Lab was used heavily to clean the data</li>
    <li>Traffic Fatalities, Property Values, and Weather data sets were less cumbersome
    </li>
    <li>Removed & renamed columns
    </li>
    <li>Datetimeindex
    </li>
    <li>Groupby month
    </li>
    <li>Valuetype error</li>
  </ul>
